# Stencil Router / Redux Demo

This project is a very simple demo of a stencil-redux working alongside stencil-router. It was creating using standard methods (`npm init stencil`), with a few extra installs: `redux`, `@stencil/redux`, `redux-logger`, and `stencil-router`.

The store is created in the `app-root` container and passed to routes using:

`componentProps={{ store: this.store }}`

It works as you'd expect!
